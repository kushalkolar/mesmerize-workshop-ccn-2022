# Mesmerize Data Structures

The Mesmerize Viewer is based on the pyqtgraph [ImageView](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/widgets/imageview.html) widget for the GUI 
and the underlying data that are being displayed are stored a [ViewerWorkEnv](http://docs.mesmerizelab.org/en/master/api_reference/Viewer_data_types.html#viewerworkenv) 
object.
