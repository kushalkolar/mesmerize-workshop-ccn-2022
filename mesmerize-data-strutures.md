# Mesmerize Data Structures

The Mesmerize Viewer is based on the pyqtgraph [ImageView](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/widgets/imageview.html) widget for the GUI 
and the underlying data that are being displayed are stored a [ViewerWorkEnv](http://docs.mesmerizelab.org/en/master/api_reference/Viewer_data_types.html#viewerworkenv) 
object.

Contribution walkthrough:

- Install PyCharm IDE.
1. Examples of changing a .py file or .rst docs file.
- Just use Eric's contrib examples from keep_memmap, my CaImAn PR example from last week. My contribs to `tslearn` that got me on the paper to show how welcoming the OSS community is. My `pygfx` contribs.
2. Committing that change to a fork of the repo.
3. Making a PR
